## Design 

### 1. font 
Using google FontAwosome i used the Roboto, just keeping it simple as the gameis not really focused on writing i kept the choice simple. 
 
### 2. Colours
   Game colours - As it's a simple game, i chose to keep the colour scheme very simple, by only using 3 colours max. 
   When i was doing some research on the game i wanted to create, i kept seeing a theme of a very dark background, i also read somewhere that it's easier on the eye. 
   So i decided to take that route. I got the idea of a white grid from the game logo which is actually a favicon, i liked how it looked a decided i wanted to match it.
   intially the background was dark purple but i went a bit darker as i went to ont create the game as it was a better fit and the white from the grid popped put more. The colour of the font was black until i changed the background,
   the background colour was the most important to be because it acted as a base for my colour scheme. 

### 3. logo 
The logo is a square grid, matching the sentiments on the game. As it's basically a grid game, i wanted to that to resonate in the logo,
and keep it simply by making them the same colour, i wanted everything to link together, and makig th whole game cohesive.

### 4 Game grid
Similar to the logo grid, same the colour, just to make the game design come together. Although the grid changes in size as the continue to up a level, the theme remains.
